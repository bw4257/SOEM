BW's Notes for using SOEM

Follow install, as in the root README.md

mkdir SOEM/test/linux/bw
copy CMakeLists.txt
copy or make some myEtherCAT.c

edit CMakeLists.txt to have the above .c file as the source

ex. 

set(SOURCES myEtherCAT.c)
add_executable(myEtherCAT ${SOURCES})
target_link_libraries(myEtherCAT soem)
install(TARGETS myEtherCAT DESTINATION bin)

edit
/home/bwalter/Documents/SOEM/CMakeLists.txt

near the end of the CMakeLists.txt file add the new test directory

ex.
    add_subdirectory(test/linux/bw)


from the build directory run:

cmake ..
make

this should build the new Ethercat file
